# 🍕 Pizza Delivery Application

## Overview
This **Pizza Delivery App** is a dynamic and user-friendly web application built using the **MERN Stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). The project was developed as part of my **Web Development and Designing internship at Oasis Infobyte**, where I successfully completed **Level 3 tasks** to enhance the app's functionality.

The application enables users to **customize their pizzas, place orders, and make secure online payments** using Razorpay. On the admin side, a **mini inventory management system** tracks ingredient availability in real-time, ensuring a smooth ordering process.
